# Asteroids

This is my own version of the famous Atari game, created following the [Boots.dev](https://boots.dev) backend onilne coursework. This was a fun exercise and I plan to add on to it to make it more uniqe and personalized.

## To Do

- [ ] Add a scoring system
- [ ] Implement multiple lives and respawning
- [ ] Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- [ ] Add acceleration to the player movement
- [ ] Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- [ ] Add a background image
- [ ] Create different weapon types
- [ ] Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- [ ] Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- [ ] Add a shield power-up
- [ ] Add a speed power-up
- [ ] Add bombs that can be dropped
- [ ] Deploy and share it with friends and family
